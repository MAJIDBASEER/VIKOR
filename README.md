# VIKOR

VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje

The VIKOR method is a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) or multi-criteria decision analysis method.Originally developed by Serafim Opricovic to solve decision problems with conflicting and noncommensurable (different units) criteria, assuming that compromise is acceptable for conflict resolution, the decision maker wants a solution that is the closest to the ideal, and the alternatives are evaluated according to all established criteria. VIKOR ranks alternatives and determines the solution named compromise that is the closest to the ideal.

The idea of compromise solution was introduced in MCDM by Po-Lung Yu in 1973 and Milan Zeleny.

S. Opricovic had developed the basic ideas of VIKOR in his Ph.D. dissertation in 1979, and an application was published in 1980. The name VIKOR appeared in 1990 from Serbian: VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje,means: Multicriteria Optimization and Compromise Solution, with pronunciation: vikor.

# Calculations 

The MCDM problem is  calculated as following.

Determine the best (compromise) solution in multicriteria sense from the set of J feasible alternatives A1, A2, ...AJ, evaluated according to the set of n criterion functions.
The input data are the elements fij of the performance (decision) matrix, where fij is the value of the i-th criterion function for the alternative Aj.
